# Eukariot



to build from source (im assuming you are on linux here. If you are windows or mac OS... maybe dont compile from source unless you know how to):<br>
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/theskyedoctor/CellsAtWork.git<br>
  cd Eukariot<br>
  mkdir build<br>
  cd build<br>
  cmake ..<br>
  make<br>

the executable will now be in the build/src directory.
