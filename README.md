# CellsAtWork



to build from source (im assuming you are on linux here. If you are windows or mac OS... maybe dont compile from source unless you know how to):
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/theskyedoctor/CellsAtWork.git
  cd CellsAtWork
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make

the executable will now be in the build/src directory.
