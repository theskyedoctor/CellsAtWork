# Eukariot

A game engine built on SDL.  
Its for my wife so she can make a roguelike inspired by conways game of life and bacterial growth.  

Simply run the install.sh script to compile and have a working executable ready in your build folder.  

otherwise, you can do it manually.  
build from source instructions (on linux):  
mkdir build  
cd build   
cmake ..   
make  
./Eukariot  

done :3
